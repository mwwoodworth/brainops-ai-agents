- **Strategic Responses:** 2

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Schema Alignment
All agents use correct production schema:
- ‚úÖ `latency_ms` (not `duration_ms`)
- ‚úÖ `agent_type` string matching (not `agent_id` FK)
- ‚úÖ `status = 'success'` (not `'completed'`)
- ‚úÖ Extended time windows (7 days for historical data)
- ‚úÖ Decimal to float conversion

### Error Handling
- Try-except blocks for all database operations
- Graceful degradation for missing columns
- Fallback behavior for failed queries
- Comprehensive logging

### Continuous Operation
Each agent has autonomous loop:
- System Improvement: 6 hours
- Customer Success: 4 hours
- Vision Alignment: 6 hours
- DevOps Optimization: 2 hours
- Code Quality: 12 hours
- Competitive Intelligence: 8 hours

---

## üìù Known Limitations

1. **Historical Data:** Some old records use `status = 'completed'` instead of `'success'`. Agents handle gracefully.

2. **Optional Queries:** Some queries check for columns that may not exist (e.g., `total_executions` in agents table). Protected with try-except.

3. **Test Data Context:** Current analysis uses test customer accounts (Weathercraft, Centerpoint). Agents successfully demonstrated capabilities on test data.

4. **Continuous Loops:** Initialized but not yet running on production schedule. Ready to enable.

---
