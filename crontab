# Memory sync cron job - DISABLED
# Reason: memory_sync_cron.py was archived and no longer exists.
# Additionally, cron is never started in the Docker container (no cron service in Dockerfile).
# The PYTHONPATH also incorrectly referenced /root/ but the container runs as appuser.
# Keeping this file for documentation purposes only.
#
# Original entry (do not re-enable without creating the script and fixing the path):
# */5 * * * * cd /app && PYTHONPATH=/root/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages python memory_sync_cron.py >> /var/log/memory_sync.log 2>&1
